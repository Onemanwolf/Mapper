# Adapter Pattern
We will exploere a Adapter pattern using AutoMapper, in this example we are mapping a domain model to a DTO and then saving the DTO (Data Transfer Object) to Cosmos Database as JSON object.
Some may say I am using a DTO in the wrong way but I just want to seperate perisitance concerns from my domain model here would love to here your feedback.
